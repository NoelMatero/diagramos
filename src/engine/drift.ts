/**
 * Drift detection: does a diagram still agree with the repository?
 *
 * A committed diagram is documentation, and documentation rots. A node can
 * record what it stands for -- `ref: "src/engine/layout.ts"`, or
 * `path#symbol` -- and this compares those claims against the working tree.
 *
 * Deliberately shallow: no model, no import graph, just existence. Being cheap
 * and quiet matters more here than being thorough, because a check that is slow
 * or cries wolf gets switched off, and then it catches nothing at all.
 *
 * Two rules keep false positives near zero:
 *
 * - A node with no ref is skipped, never guessed at from its label ("Auth"
 *   could be anything). The one exception is a label that is unambiguously a
 *   path, which is reported as `inferred` so a caller can weigh it accordingly.
 * - Hand-drawn nodes are ignored entirely. A box someone sketched is an
 *   intention, not a claim about code that exists today.
