 * Reports diagrams that no longer match the code.
 *
 *   npm run check:drift                      # every board under docs/diagrams
 *   npm run check:drift docs/diagrams/a.excalidraw b.excalidraw
 *   npm run check:drift -- --hook            # as a Claude Code Stop hook
 *
 * Silent when nothing has drifted. That is the point: this is meant to run on
 * every turn, and a check that announces good news thirty times an hour is a
 * check someone turns off.
 *
 * Two ways out, because two readers want opposite things:
 *
 * - **A terminal, CI, a pre-commit hook** want the report on stderr and a
 *   non-zero exit, so a build can fail on it. That is the default.
 * - **A Claude Code Stop hook** wants `--hook`: the report goes out as a
 *   `systemMessage` on stdout and the process exits 0.
 *
 * That second channel was measured rather than assumed, three times. Plain text on
 * stdout with exit 0 is discarded silently. stderr with a non-zero exit shows, but
 * Claude Code wraps it in "Stop hook error: Failed with non-blocking status code",
 * which reads as a broken tool rather than a finding — the check spent its whole
 * life apologising for working. Structured JSON on stdout renders as an ordinary
 * notice, and newlines, indentation, box-drawing characters, symbols and ANSI
 * colour all survive it.
 *
 * Colour took two rounds to settle, and the first answer was wrong: escapes were
 * put in a notice and the reply came back as pasted text, where colour is invisible
 * either way. It renders. Severity is carried by colour rather than emoji, which
 * matters beyond looks — an escape occupies no cells, while `⚠️` is ambiguous-width
 * and sheared every padded row it appeared in.
 *
 * The JSON shape below is the one that was measured. Slimming it is not obviously
 * safe without measuring again.
