/**
 * Bundles the published entry points into plain JavaScript.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-cli.mjs
 *
 * The package ships JS, not TypeScript: a consumer installed through `npx` has
 * no tsx and no devDependencies, so the sources have to be transpiled before
 * publish. Dependencies stay external — npm resolves those.
 *
 * Wired to `prepare` rather than `postinstall` in package.json, because prepare
 * runs on a local install and before publish but *not* when a consumer installs
 * the published package — which has no esbuild or vite to build with, and gets
 * the output in the tarball instead.
 *
 * OUT_DIR is two levels below the package root on purpose. Three modules locate
 * their assets relative to their own file (`../..`):
 *
 *   src/engine/convert.ts  -> vendor/excalidraw-headless.mjs
 *   src/engine/render.ts   -> vendor/excalidraw-browser.js
 *   src/server/board-server.ts -> out/viewer
 *
 * Bundling collapses all three onto this output file, so its depth *is* their
 * root calculation. Moving this output one directory shallower or deeper breaks
 * rendering and the live board at runtime, silently, in a way tests running from
 * source cannot see. The assertion below fails the build instead.
