/**
 * Box-drawn tables for the drift report.
 *
 * Why a module of its own: getting a grid to line up is arithmetic, and
 * arithmetic deserves tests. Every border and every row must come out the same
 * display width or the box reads as broken software rather than a table.
 *
 * Two things make that arithmetic non-obvious.
 *
 * **Emoji are not one column wide.** `❌` occupies two terminal cells while
 * being one code point, and `⚠️` is two code points (the symbol plus an
 * invisible variation selector) rendering in one or two cells. Padding by
 * `String.length` therefore shears any row containing one. WIDE lists the few
 * symbols this report uses and their real width; nothing else is assumed.
 *
 * **Colour is zero width.** ANSI escapes must be excluded from the measurement
 * and re-applied after padding, or a coloured cell pushes its row out by the
 * length of the escape codes. They are also stripped entirely from a Claude Code
 * `systemMessage`, so colour is only ever emitted to a real terminal.

 * Two cells, not one.

 * The emoji blocks from U+1F300 up are East Asian Wide, and so are a handful of
 * older symbols that default to emoji presentation. Everything else here — arrows,
 * box drawing, the ellipsis — is a single cell, and assuming otherwise shears rows
 * just as badly in the other direction.
 *
 * Deliberately not a guess-by-range-only: `⚠` (U+26A0) is *ambiguous* width, one
 * cell in some terminals and two in others, so it is not usable in a padded row at
 * all. That is what sheared this box the first time.
